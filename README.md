- 📁 New Public Repository: This new public GitHub profile contains both old (starting from approx. 2015) and new my projects, uploaded now after years of working in a private capacity due to privacy policies of my employers. 
- 📁 Project Uploads: All projects uploaded here are from my personal endeavors and university research. Due to privacy policies at SAP SE, where I am employed, I am unable to share work-related projects publicly. These repositories exclusively feature my private projects and are newly uploaded to this fresh GitHub profile. Thank you for your understanding.
