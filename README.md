- üì´ How to reach me: tatjana.chernenko.work@gmail.com
- üìÅ New Public Repository: This new public GitHub profile contains both old (starting from approx. 2015) and new my projects, uploaded now after years of working in a private capacity due to privacy policies of my employers. 
- üìÅ Project Uploads: All projects uploaded here are from my personal endeavors and university research. Due to privacy policies at SAP SE, where I am employed, I am unable to share work-related projects publicly. These repositories exclusively feature my private projects and are newly uploaded to this fresh GitHub profile. Thank you for your understanding.

# My Projects

## Research
### NLP / ML
- [CHERTOY: Word Sense Induction for better web search result clustering, 2017/2018](https://github.com/TatjanaChernenko/word_sense_induction_CHERTOY_system/tree/main) - An approach to improve word sense induction systems (WSI) for web search result clustering. Exploring the boundaries of vector space models for the WSI Task. CHERTOY system. Authors: Tatjana Chernenko, Utaemon Toyota.
  
*Key words: word sense induction, web search results clubstering, ML, NLP, word2vec, sent2vec, NLP, data science, data processing.*

- [Natural Language Generation from structured inputs](https://github.com/TatjanaChernenko/image_description_generation) - This project investigates the generation of descriptions of images focusing on spatial relationships between the objects and sufficient attributes for the objects. Leveraging an encoder-decoder architecture with LSTM cells (the Dong et al. (2017) is taken as basis), the system transforms normalized vector representations of attributes into fixed-length vectors. These vectors serve as initial states for a decoder generating target sentences from sequences in description sentences.

*Key words: natural language generation, encoder-decoder, ML, NLP, data science, feed-forward neural network, LSTMs.*
