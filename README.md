## Research Repositories
### NLP / ML
- 2017/2018 [CHERTOY: Word Sense Induction for better web search result clustering](https://github.com/TatjanaChernenko/word_sense_induction_CHERTOY_system/tree/main) - An approach to improve **word sense induction systems (WSI)** for web search result clustering. Exploring the boundaries of vector space models for the WSI Task. CHERTOY system. Authors: Tatjana Chernenko, Utaemon Toyota.

Whitepaper - [link](https://github.com/TatjanaChernenko/word_sense_induction_CHERTOY_system/blob/main/Results.pdf)
  
*Key words: word sense induction, web search results clustering, ML, NLP, word2vec, sent2vec, NLP, data science, data processing.*

- 2018 [Data-to-text: Natural Language Generation from structured inputs](https://github.com/TatjanaChernenko/image_description_generation) - This project investigates the **generation of descriptions of images** focusing on spatial relationships between the objects and sufficient attributes for the objects. Leveraging an encoder-decoder architecture with LSTM cells (the Dong et al. (2017) is taken as basis), the system transforms normalized vector representations of attributes into fixed-length vectors. These vectors serve as initial states for a decoder generating target sentences from sequences in description sentences.

Whitepaper - [link](https://github.com/TatjanaChernenko/image_description_generation/blob/main/docs/Paper_NL_generation.pdf)

*Key words: natural language generation, encoder-decoder, ML, NLP, data science, feed-forward neural network, LSTMs.*

- 2018 [Text Summarization research: Optimizing LexRank system with ECNU features](https://github.com/TatjanaChernenko/text_summarization_LexRank_modified_ecnu) -  enhancing the LexRank-based **text summarization** system by incorporating semantic similarity measures from the ECNU system. The LexRank-based text summarization system employs a stochastic graph-based method to compute the relative importance of textual units for extractive multi-document text summarization. This implementation initially utilizes cosine similarity between sentences as a key metric. In this model, a connectivity matrix based on intra-sentence cosine similarity is used as the adjacency matrix of the graph representation of sentences. The objective is to explore the impact of replacing cosine similarity with a combination of features from the ECNU system, known for its semantic similarity measure. This modification aims to improve the summarization effectiveness of the LexRank approach.

Important when training data is limited, especially in Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL) applications.
